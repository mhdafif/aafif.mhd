    A passionate and detail-oriented <span class="text-star">
      Frontend Developer
    </span> with <span class="text-star"> {yearsOfExperience}+ years</span> of experience
    specializing in building modern, scalable, and performant web applications. I
    have a strong foundation in JavaScript and TypeScript, and have worked extensively

    life in responsive, maintainable, and user-centric interfaces.

    In addition to frontend development, I`ve recently been learning and growing
    in areas like <span class="text-star"
      >backend development, CI/CD workflows, and AI-powered automation</span

  <p class="mb-4">
    I thrive in collaborative environments that value clean code, knowledge
    sharing, and thoughtful architecture. I enjoy mentoring others, building
    shared tools like internal UI frameworks and boilerplates, and pushing for
    consistent, scalable frontend standards. My goal is always to create user
    experiences that are elegant, efficient, and a joy to interact with.
